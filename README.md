# aurelia-buttonbar-poc
POC for exploring options to create a button controller where all the buttons have very similar functionality

## Concept
Explore the different possibilities for creating a "button bar" control in Aurelia where there are a large number of buttons that share a view and only different in presentation (and some end-result action).

## Real World Example
Think of a toolbar for a Rich Text Editor where there are "bold", "italic", "underline", "strikethrough" buttons that largely look and function the same.

## Usage

Using the Aurelia CLI `au run -watch`
